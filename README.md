Three-Dee Maze Game
===================

The code in this repository implements a simple 3D maze game in JavaScript using WebGL. To see it in action, copy it into an .html file and open that file in a web browser that runs JavaScript. Or, to play an online version, visit http://thiscouldbebetter.neocities.org/threedeemazegame.html.

You can move the player with the W, A, S, D, Z, and C keys, and zoom the camera in or out with the R and F keys. The goal is to navigate through a four-by-four maze to reach the... er, slightly-less-gray.... square.
